## Important
API Requests from this app are limited in Google Cloud Console (4000/day and 800/min), so it may stop working. This is the largest project I've ever done, but it's also one of the first projects I did after learning web development for a few months. I skipped learning vanilla JS and just started writing this project in Vue.js, so this app definitely isn't production-ready and well-written. Still, in an ordinary scenario, all features work fine.
